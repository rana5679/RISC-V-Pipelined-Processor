Release Notes:
        What works:
* All R, I, B, SB, J & U instructions
        What does not work:
* Did not implement the additional instructions (ECALL, EBREAK, PAUSE, FENCE, and FENCE.TSO)
        Issues:
* Yet to follow most coding guidelines
* Missing loading the memories from hex file (hardcoded the instructions for now and added hex text files instead of .hex for now)
* Did not test of the FPGA
        Assumptions:
* Passing basic tests guarantees functionality (did not thoroughly test instructions)
